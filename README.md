This repository contains the code for _tracking-termites_ project, in which we
are trying to devise an automatic method of tracking termites samples in video
and report his current positions, encounters and distances along time. The
project is conducted at University Federal of Vi√ßosa Termitology Lab.

Tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04.

The easiest way to get started is to download the repository in your machine
and inside the project folder, run

```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
on Windows, or
```
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
on Linux.

Python 3.6 must be installed on your machine with the `pip` command also
available.

If everything went fine you should now head to the _data_ folder, copy your
videos there and edit the input file (an example is already provided). When
everything is ready simply execute the _tracking.py_ file using your Python 3.6 interpreter.
